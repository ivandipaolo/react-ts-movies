### The graphQL Playground do not correspond to the Back-End repo on this link
### [https://movieql.netlify.app/](https://movieql.netlify.app/)

## As you can see the queries are different:
### https://movieql.netlify.app/graphql

### http://localhost:3131/graphql corresponding to https://github.com/hwhang0917/ql-movie-api

# Query fails:
### 
```
Error while trying to get the movies genres into nowPlayingMovies query and popularMovies query
[GraphQL error]: Message: Cannot return null for non-nullable field Movie.genres.
Location: [object Object], Path: nowPlayingMovies,movies,0,genres
 query GetGenresForMovies{
   nowPlayingMovies {
     movies{
       id
       genres {
         id
         name
       }
     }
   }
   popularMovies {
     movies{
       id
       genres {
         id
         name
       }
     }
   }
 }
```
Making the test with their playground:

### This is why I am getting the movie genres by the query getMovieById on each MovieCard and sending it to the reducer.
